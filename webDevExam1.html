        <p>
            Before Nihon came into official use, Japan was known as <em><strong>Wa</em> (倭)</strong> or <strong><em>Wakoku </em>(倭国)</strong>. 
            Wa was a name early China used to refer to an ethnic group living in Japan around the time of the <strong>Three Kingdoms Period</strong>.
            The Yayoi people primarily lived on the <strong>island of Kyushu</strong> to the <strong>Kanto region</strong> on Honshu.

        <p>
            The classic period of Japan began in the late <Strong>8th century</Strong>, and the Heian period saw the archipelago transformed in four centuries. 
            The last division of classic Japanese history is the Heian period which ran from 794 to 1185. 
            The Heian period was followed by the Nara Period.

        <p>
            The feudal era of Japan consisted of three main periods, <strong>the Kamakura period, Muromachi period, and Azuchi-Momoyama period</strong>, each named for the shoguns who controlled Japan. 
            During these periods, the Emperor technically controlled the country, but in reality, the shogun had more political power.

        <p>
            Early modern Japan, or the period between <strong>1600</strong> and <strong>1868</strong>, witnessed the birth of many of Japan's most enduring cultural and political attributes, as well as the expansion of its basic geographic boundaries.

        <p>
            It was the <strong>Meiji Restoration</strong> that finally abolished the strict class system and created a more free and democratic system that allowed the Japanese people to unleash their full potential. Under this new democratic system, Japan modernized and developed rapidly.
